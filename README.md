# Practical Machine Learning Project

I've created a gh-pages for this project as well. 
Here is the list of files and what they are for:

1. _Project.Rmd_ - is the main RMD file used to generate the Project.html report
1. _RonAWS.Rmd_ - is a RMD file used to generate te RonAWS.html file (a description of how I ran on AWS EC2)
1. _Project.R_ - is an R script that I used to do my initial work on the project
1. _Project Remote.R_ - is the R script used on the AWS server
1. _Atesting.R_ - a small script to help me finish writing up the project report
1. _Atesting2.R_ - some last minute tests just prior to project deadline
1. _rfFullModel2b.rds_ - is the persisted model fit using random forest 
1. _modelFitGBM.rds_ - is the persisted model fit using GBM (a very last minute attempt to get better accuracy)
1. _FinalModelPlot.png_ - a graphic used in my report (the plot method fails when run with knitr for some reason)
1. _Project.html_ and _RonAWS.html_ - output from the RMD files produced by knitr and viewable on the gh-pages
